# feature_selection

Does feature selection methods improve the predictive performance and computation time of a range of well-known machine learning models? This is the answer that this project aimed to answer.<br>We conducted a large scale experiment through OpenML on a subset of the OpenML-CC18 dataset, a well-curated classification dataset. We find that feature selection can greatly decrease training and prediction time, but does little in terms of predictive performance gain. In fact, it may instead hurt performance slightly.
